The Property \"units\" is a single value that is one of \"C\", \"F\" or \"K\". It provides the unit of measurement for the \"temperature\" value. It is a read-only value that is provided by the server. If the \"units\" Property is missing the default is Celsius [C]. When the Property \"range\" is omitted the default is +/- MAXINT. A client can specify the units for the requested temperature by use of a query parameter. If no query parameter is provided the server provides its default measure or set value. It is recommended to return always the units Property in the result.",
