      "description": "This Resource specifies the pan tilt and zoom capabilities of a device. The Resource Type is dynamic and reflects whether the values apply to physical movement of the device or digital/virtual enhancements to the image. For physical movement the Resource Type is \"oic. r. movement. ptz\". For digital/virtual image enhancements the Resource Type is \"oic. r. image. ptz\". The Properties \"pan\" and \"tilt\" are specified in degrees. The Property \"zoomFactor\" is a value in the range 1-100 for linear (optical) zoom. The zoom factor is a value in the range [1x, 2x, 4x, 8x, 16x, 32x] for digital zoom. If there is no zoom value to set the zoom factor shall be '1x'. The value 0 degrees means neutral, this is a vendor defined setting. Note that this resource also can be used to create an offset for physical movement. When that is the case, the Resource Type value is: \"oic. r. movement. offset. ptz\" Note that this resource also can be used to create an offset for image movement. When that is the case, the Resource Type value is: \"oic. r. image. offset. ptz\". When the Property \"pan_range\" value is omitted, then the range is [-180. 0,180. 0]. If \"pan\" is not supported then the range shall be [0. 0,0. 0] When the Property \"tilt_range\" value is omitted, then the range is [-180. 0,180. 0]. If \"tilt\" is not supported then the range shall be [0. 0,0. 0].",
